# Yet Another Grid Router for Selenium

The product was inspired by a GGC and Yandex GR. Both turned to be not quite friendly for .NET-ters so here you go.

## Running router

The project is currently under heavy development.

* setup selenoid instances
* update src/appsettings.json with your solenoid hubs
* run the router using

```bash
cd src
dotnet run
```
